Unsupervised classification and separation of objects in 3D

Object segmentation for the purpose object and pattern recognition has been a long standing subject of interest in the field of machine vision.
Despite the significant attention given to the development of segmentation and recognition methods, the critical challenge of separating merged objects did not share the spotlight.
In the work presented in this manuscript, we propose a simple yet novel approach to overcome this hurdle, by developing a methodology for unsupervised classification and separation of objects in 3D.
Lower dimensionality classifiers are joined to provide a powerful higher dimensionality classification.
The robustness of this approach is illustrated through its implementation on two case studies of merged objects.
Applications of this methodology can further extend from structural classification to general problems of clustering and classification in various fields.

In this project we present a methodology for unsupervised separation and classification of merged objects in 3D.
The foundation on which our methodology was built upon, is one of the central ideas in learning - Boosting.
By incorporating several "weak classifiers" to form a "committee", boosting methods produce a robust classifier.
Furthermore, the suggested methodology was expended to establish a framework applicable to the field of microstructural modeling.
We focused in particular on fiber reinforced composite materials, and the described methods were implemented on a ceramic matrix composite arranged in an eight-harness weave architecture and a high-performance fiber reinforced concrete.
